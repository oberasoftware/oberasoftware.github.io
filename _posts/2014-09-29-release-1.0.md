We have finally released JasDB 1.0 release, with this release we have set out to become a fully open source project with all the benefits. We are very
excited with this step into a fully open source world.

### Features

* Enhanced and fixed many query engine issues
* Changed core to be based on Spring logic instead of Guice
* Introduced a new UI Console
* Improved storage reliability
* Fully statefull application, metadata now stored in a local '.jasdb' folder
* All bags, instances can be managed through the UI
* Fully open sourced release on Bitbucket
* Artefacts are available in Maven central

## Artefacts

As already announced before we have moved our maven artefacts, and you will need to adjust your Maven / dependency management build scripts.

### Maven Central

All our artefacts are now available in Maven Central, you no longer are required to setup our artefact repository in your build script.

**GroupId changed**
In order to facilitate the change to Maven Central we had to change the groupId to be in line with our website. The groupId is
now 'com.oberasoftware' for all our artefacts.

#### Maven dependencies
If you want to use the REST client for JasDB add the following dependency to your pom file:
{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.oberasoftware</groupId>
   <artifactId>jasdb_restconnector</artifactId>
   <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

When you want to run JasDB inside your application without using REST the following dependency is needed:
{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.oberasoftware</groupId>
   <artifactId>jasdb_localservice</artifactId>
   <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}
