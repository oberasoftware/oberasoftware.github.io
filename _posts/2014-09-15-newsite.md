It has been a while since you saw some news from us. A lot has happened personally and with oberasoftware in the last year. We have decided
in order to make sure we can keep progress in JasDB that we will start fully open sourcing the project. We already opensource the biggest portion
of the code, but now we will also release the code of the indexers and rest service.

Next to this we are working on some other things:

* Opensource and move all sourcecode to Github
* Move maven artefacts to Maven Central
* Building a web UI for quick diagnosis of JasDB status
* Reworking the core kernel of JasDB for extensibility

We will release JasDB 1.0 in the next few weeks after we have completed the testing cycles. Keep checking our new website for more information about the new release.
