Recently we at Oberasoftware have been working at several other open source projects which we are putting at Github. To centralize all our efforts we have decided to move JasDB as well to Github. We will keep the repository on bitbucket available, but will no longer update this.

## GIT Repositories
The repository is available on this URL: https://github.com/oberasoftware/jasdb-open

It can be cloned as following:
{% highlight java %}
git clone https://github.com/oberasoftware/jasdb-open.git
{% endhighlight %}

## Download
We have also moved the downloads, to get your copy go here: [JasDB v1.0](https://github.com/oberasoftware/jasdb-open/releases/download/v1.0/jasdb_1.0.zip)
