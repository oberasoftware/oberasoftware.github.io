We have released a version of JasDB containing a small bug fix. We recommend downloading this latest version of the DB. The old v0.6.3 version is still available for download. This bugfix release contains the following fixes:

* JASDB-31: The UUID generation was random and in some huge datasets, tested on the same JVM, we got duplicate keys. The UUID generation is now sequential, preventing any collisions.
* JASDB-173: The inverted index produced large index data files. This has now been significantly reduced.
* JASDB-174: The btree does not handle fields with spaces at the start or end correctly after loading from disk. The keys are now stored consistently between creation and loading from disk.
* JASDB-175: The btree character based keys are not always stored in Unicode when platform encoding is not set correctly. Character based keys are now always stored in Unicode.

With this release we are also introducing a new versioning system that allows us to release minor patch fixes which do not contain breaking changes. For a detailed description of the release versioning, go to the following page: JasDB Release Versioning
