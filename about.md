## About Us
Obera Software is a fresh new startup looking to add something of value to the NoSQL community. We are guided by the principle of simplicity which gives its name to our first product, JasDB (Just A Simple DB). We apply simplicity to everything we do, from our website, to the deep inner workings of our storage solution and you will experience the difference when you use JasDB. Thats why you wonâ€™t find a lot of waste in our site or in our product. Just the bare essentials that add real value.

By day, I am a lead software tester at SDL Media Manager which means I watch videos for a living, but it's ok, because they're in the cloud.

By night I paint, watch Jurassic Park and dream of the Future.
